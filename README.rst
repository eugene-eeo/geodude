A (hopefully) well tested, educational Python library for learning
computational geometry. Based on my reading of Springer's excellent
`Computational Geometry <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-540-77974-2>`_.
Algorithms implemented:

- Convex hulls
  - QuickHull
  - Gift Wrapping (Jarvis)
  - Graham Scan
